          <h2>Introduction to JPG and PNG</h2>
          <p>
          JPG has been a standard format for digital images for decades, known for its widespread compatibility and relatively small file sizes due to its lossy compression. On the other hand, PNG is an advanced image format that offers lossless compression, ensuring that no image quality is lost during the compression process. PNG also supports transparency, making it ideal for various graphic design applications.

          <h2>Why Convert JPG to PNG?</h2>
          <p>
          While JPG is widely supported and efficient in terms of file size, converting JPG images to PNG can be beneficial for preserving image quality and utilizing transparency features. Converting JPG to PNG ensures that images maintain their highest possible fidelity and can be used in a variety of design and web applications.

          <h2>Understanding JPG Compression</h2>
          <p>
          JPG achieves its impressive compression ratios by discarding some image data, which can result in a slight loss of quality. Techniques such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization help to compress images efficiently, making JPG an excellent choice for reducing file sizes, particularly for photographic content.

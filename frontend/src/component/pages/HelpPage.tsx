        <h3>3. Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Slow Conversion:</strong> If the conversion process is taking longer than expected, try reducing the file size or resolution of your AVIF image before uploading it to avif2png.com. You can also check your internet connection speed and server load to ensure optimal performance.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Messages:</strong> If you receive an error message during the conversion process, double-check that your AVIF image meets the file size and format requirements specified on the upload page. You may also want to try clearing your browser cache and cookies or using a different web browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Incomplete Conversion:</strong> If your converted PNG or JPG file appears incomplete or distorted, it may be due to issues with the original AVIF image file. Try re-uploading the AVIF image and initiating the conversion process again to see if the problem persists.</li>
